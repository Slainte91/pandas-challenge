Games that target the 15 to 30 year old market will have the widest audience, with over 75% of players being in this age group.

While women and "other" genders were less likely to appear, they spent more on average, so finding a way to get more women and "other" 
gender types in our market may mean higher average purchase price.

The youngest audience spent the second most on average per game, with 35-39 year old spending the most. 
Targeting 35-39 year olds with children may be a good strategy when developing games.
